Issue with value classes and inline functions in Kotlin/JS 2.0.0-Beta1
(works correctly with 1.9.21)

./gradlew jsBrowserDevelopmentRun

see console in browser,

the line that is incorrect is:
"prefix2-MyWrapper2(inner=null)"

it should be:
"prefix2-"

whole code is in Main.js.kt file.
see there for details in comments
